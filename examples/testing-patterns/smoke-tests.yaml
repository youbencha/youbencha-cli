# Quick Smoke Test Suite
# Purpose: Fast sanity checks before running comprehensive evaluations
# Analogy: Like pre-commit hooks or linting - catches obvious issues quickly

version: "1.0.0"
repo: https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git
branch: master

agent:
  type: copilot-cli
  config:
    prompt: "Add error handling to the main function"

# Basic checks that run quickly
evaluators:
  # Git diff gives us baseline metrics
  - name: git-diff
    # No config needed - just track the changes
  
  # Agentic judge for quick quality checks
  - name: agentic-judge
    config:
      type: copilot-cli
      agent_name: agentic-judge  # Use specialized evaluation agent
      timeout: 60000  # 1 minute max - keep it fast
      
      # Criteria focused on "smoke test" concerns
      criteria:
        syntax_valid: "Code has no obvious syntax errors"
        files_modified: "At least one file was modified"
        no_todos: "No TODO comments left in production code"
        basic_error_handling: "Basic error handling patterns present (try-catch or error returns)"

# Expected outcomes:
# - Runs in < 2 minutes
# - Catches obvious problems (syntax errors, no changes made, etc.)
# - Use this before expensive comprehensive evaluations
# - Perfect for CI pipelines that need fast feedback

# Usage:
# yb run -c smoke-tests.yaml
# 
# If this passes, proceed to comprehensive-suite.yaml
# If this fails, fix the obvious issues first
