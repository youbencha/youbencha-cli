# Test Case with Variable Substitution Example
#
# This example demonstrates using variables defined in .youbencharc
# to avoid hardcoding values in test case configurations.
#
# In your .youbencharc, define:
# variables:
#   REPO_BASE: https://github.com/myorg
#   DEFAULT_BRANCH: main
#   PROJECT_NAME: my-project

name: "Variable Substitution Example"
description: "Demonstrates using ${PROJECT_NAME} variables from youBencha config"

# Use variables from .youbencharc
repo: ${REPO_BASE}/hello-world.git
branch: ${DEFAULT_BRANCH}
